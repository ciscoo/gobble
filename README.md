# Gobble :chicken:

Gobble is my personal [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) boilerplate, nothing more. Feel free to fork.

## Quick Start

There are a couple ways to get started:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/ciscoo/gobble/archive/master.zip).
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ciscoo/gobble.git`.
